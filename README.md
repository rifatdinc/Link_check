- The Alignment Problem -
imagine that you are doing right and left to the antenna on a 50-meter pole, you need to constantly look at the phone or someone will tell you the signal. I think I've found a very good solution to this. I've turned the signal into a sound. The person doing the installation work only needs to wear a headset, and he tells you the incoming signal in seconds(Speaking). Currently, mikrotik applies to mimosa.
- The company I work for has a lot of instant network devices that I follow. I get data for these using snmp,api, web scraping.
